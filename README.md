# üåç **DengueScope: A Multi-Modal Machine Learning Framework for Dengue Forecasting**  

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)  

DengueScope is a machine learning-based system designed to predict dengue outbreaks using a diverse set of geospatial, climatic, socio-economic, and human mobility data. The project integrates novel data sources such as Google Trends alongside models such as TCN, TFT, CatBoost, LSTM, BlendeStackEnsemble  to enhance dengue prediction accuracy across Brazilian cities.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Dengue is a major public health concern, especially in tropical regions like Brazil. DengueScope aims to predict dengue outbreaks with maximum accuracy by leveraging:

- **Geospatial Data**: Population density, urbanization, and spatial spread of dengue cases.
- **Climatic Data**: Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other environmental factors.
- **Socio-economic Data**: Income levels, healthcare access, and population vulnerability.
- **Google Searches**: Google Trends data
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual representation of dengue spread across Brazilian states
